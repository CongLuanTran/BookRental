# Comic Book Rental Shop
This is a basic implementation of a comic book rental shop.
The list of books available is stored in a text file and can be retrieved when starting the application.

This application can:
1. Add comic books to the database
2. Search based on the name of the book (with partial matching)
3. Search based on the name of the author (must enter the whole correct name)
4. Update the rental price of the book
5. Remove a book from the database

When the user exit the application, all books that still remain in the store will be saved back to the text file.
